This example shows how to use bands.x to check the band symmetry of
fcc-Pt with a fully relativistic US-PP which includes spin-orbit effects.
It also computes the DOS and wavefunctions projected on atomic states.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

1) make a self-consistent calculation for Pt (input=pt.scf.in,
   output=pt.scf.out). 

2) make a band structure calculation for Pt (input=pt.nscf.in,
   output=pt.nscf.out).

3) use the bands.x program to check the band symmetry (input=pt.bands.in,
   output=pt.bands.out).

4) use the projwfc.x program to compute the DOS projected on atomic states
  (input=pt.pdos.in, output=pt.pdos.out).
