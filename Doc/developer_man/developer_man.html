2 Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO as a distribution</A>
</H1>

<P>
Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO is not organized as a monolithic code, but rather as a
<EM>distribution</EM> (integrated suite) of ``packages'', with
varying degrees of integration, that can be installed on demand,
or sometimes independently. There is a ``shell'' structure,
with at the center the <EM>core</EM> distribution, including

<UL>
<LI>scripts, installation tools, libraries, common source files;
</LI>
<LI>basic packages

<UL>
<LI><TT>PWscf</TT>: self-consistent calculations, structural optimization,
molecular dynamics on the ground state;
</LI>
<LI><TT>CP</TT>: Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics;
</LI>
<LI><TT>PostProc</TT>: data analysis and plotting (requires <TT>PWscf</TT>).
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
Note that some libraries are downloaded on demand from the web
during the installation of the core distribution. Then comes a
shell of <EM>additional</EM> packages, that can be downloaded and
installed from the core distribution using <TT>make</TT>:

<UL>
<LI><TT>atomic</TT>: pseudopotential generation
</LI>
<LI><TT>PHonon</TT>: Density-Functional Perturbation Theory
</LI>
<LI><TT>NEB</TT>: reaction pathways and energy barriers
</LI>
<LI><TT>PWCOND</TT>: ballistic conductance
</LI>
<LI><TT>XSPECTRA</TT>: calculation of X-Ray spectra
</LI>
<LI><TT>TDDFPT</TT>: Time-dependent DFPT
</LI>
<LI><TT>EPW</TT>: electron-phonon
</LI>
<LI><TT>GIPAW</TT>: NMR coefficients and chemical shifts
</LI>
<LI><TT>GWL</TT>: GW and BSE using Lanczos chains
</LI>
<LI><TT>West</TT>: Many-body perturbation corrections to DFT.
</LI>
</UL>
All these packages use routines from the core distribution. Note that

<UL>
<LI><TT>EPW</TT> and <TT>GWL</TT> require <TT>PHonon</TT>;
</LI>
<LI><TT>GWL</TT> is not automatically downloaded in the released version;
</LI>
<LI><TT>GIPAW</TT> and <TT>West</TT> are stored in separate SVN repositories.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
There is then a shell of <EM>external</EM> packages, which typically
read data produced by Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO but do not need it to work. Some of them
(notably Yambo, Wannier90, WanT) can be automatically downloaded and
installed from the core distribution using <TT>make</TT>.

<P>
Finally there are <EM>plugins</EM>: these modify Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO packages, adding
new functionalities. Currently the following plugins are available:

<UL>
<LI><TT>Plumed</TT>,  v.1.3 only, for metadynamics;
</LI>
<LI><TT>Environ</TT>, for calculations with a solvent.

3 How to become a developer
</H1>

<P>
If you want to get involved as a developer and contribute serious
or nontrivial stuff (or even simple and trivial stuff), you should
first of all register on <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>, following the instructions.

<P>

3.1 About <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>
</H2>

<P>
<EM>Important notice: <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> will be upgraded in the next months
with new hardware and software. Some of the following pieces of
information may become obsolete.</EM>

<P>
<TT>qe-forge.org</TT> is the portal for Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO developers, contributors,
and for anybody else wanting to develop a project in the
field of atomistic simulations. <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> provides for
each project a repository, mailing lists, a wiki, upload
space, a bug tracking facility, various other tools that
are useful for developers.

<P>
Once you have obtained an account (<EM>please</EM> follow the
instructions and introduce yourself when you register: the
site administrator has to be sure that you are a real person!)
you may open your own project, retaining all rights on it
(including the right not to release anything): at the end of
the "projects" page, click on the link "add new project", fill
the form (note that the Unix name given to the project cannot
be modified). You have the choice between a repository using
CVS, SVN, <TT>git</TT>, others. Please don't even think using CVS
(obsolete), prefer <TT>git</TT> (it is easier to move the
repository).

<P>
You may as well register as a developer
in an existing project: go to the project page, click on
button ''Request to become a developer'' under the ''Activity''
graph on the top of the column at the right, to obtain the permission
from the administrator of the project (please contact the
project administratior by mail!).

<P>
You need to register your SSH keys in order to have read-write
access the repository (if you have such permissions). Generate
keys on your work machine if you haven't already, using command
<TT>ssh-keygen -t rsa</TT>. The keys are typically found
 in file <TT>.ssh/id-rsa.public</TT>. Then

<OL>
<LI>login to your <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> account
</LI>
<LI>click on My stuff (menu on top line)
</LI>
<LI>click on My account (menu on the left)
</LI>
<LI>click on Edit SSH Keys, add your keys (be careful not to add blanks,
breaks, etc.).
</LI>
</OL>

3.2 Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO on <TT>qe-forge.org</TT></A>
</H2>

<P>
Currently Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO uses the following development tools:

<UL>
<LI>SVN server (with web interface to browse the repository)
</LI>
<LI>Bug Tracking facility
</LI>
<LI>Upload space (with download counter)
</LI>
<LI>Mailing lists, currently

<UL>
<LI><TT>pw_forum</TT> (high traffic): for ordinary users,
requests for help, problems, discussions, etc.. Only
registered users can post.
</LI>
<LI><TT>q-e-developers</TT> (low traffic):
for communications among developers and people interested
in the development of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO. Only registered users can post
but messages from unregistered users are monitored and
approved if relevant.
</LI>
<LI><TT>q-e-commits</TT> (medium traffic): for automatic
commit messages. Note that replies to commit messages go
to the mailing list: in case of doubts or questions or
remarks over a specific commit, feel free to reply.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
Everybody is encouraged to explore other capabilities of <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>.

<P>
All Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO developer are <EM>strongly</EM> invited to subscribe to the
two mailing lists <TT>q-e-developers</TT> and <TT>q-e-commits</TT>.
Those who don't, lose i) the opportunity to follow what is going on,
ii) the right to complain if something has gone into a direction
they don't like. Note that subscription to mailing lists is not
automatic when you register: you should subscribe using the links
in <TT>http://www.qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e/mailman/</TT>.
Please also consider subscribing to the bug tracker: select the
"Tracker" item on the left, then select "Bugs", then click on
"Start monitoring". You will receive an e-mail every time a
bug is filed.

3.3 Contributing new developments
</H2>

<P>
Various procedures can be followed to contribute new developments.
It is possible to contribute:

<UL>
<LI>a small, or large, piece of code to an existing package; or
</LI>
<LI>a new package that uses Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO as a library; or
</LI>
<LI>a ``plugin'' that modifies Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, adding a new functionality; or
</LI>
<LI>a new ``external'' package that just reads data file produced by QE.
</LI>
</UL>
The ideal procedure depends upon the kind of project you have in mind.

<P>
As a rule: if you plan to release your work in the public release, you
should always keep your work aligned to the current development version
of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO. This is especially important if your project

<UL>
<LI>involves major or extensive or even small but critical or numerous
  changes to existing Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO routines,
</LI>
<LI>makes usage of existing (modified or unmodified) Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO routines.
</LI>
</UL>
Modifying the latest stable version is not a good idea. Modifying
an <EM>old</EM> stable version is an <EM>even worse idea</EM>. New code
based on old versions will invariably be obsolete after a few months,
<EM>very</EM> obsolete after a few years. Experience shows that new projects
may take a long time before reaching a public release, and that the
major stumbling block is the alignment to the newer Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO distribution.

<P>
The sole exception is when your changes are either relatively small, or
localized to a small part of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, or they are quite independent anyway
from the rest of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO. In that case, you can just send a patch or the
modified routine(s) to an expert developer who will review it and
take the appropriate steps.

<P>
<EM>Notice:</EM> the development model of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO has undergone
significant changes between releases 5.3 and 5.4. Since v.5.4, only
package maintainers and a few expert developers are allowed to commit
into the main ("trunk") SVN repository. Only ``safe'' changes can be
committed: the repository should always be at or close to production
status. SVN branches are discouraged: experience shows that too many
branches are never merged.

<P>
Due to various <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>limitations and a change in access policy, 
anonymous SVN access is also disabled. People who need to regularly access 
to a development version may use the link to the "Daily Snapshot" 
on the www.quantum-espresso.org web site.

<P>
People who need to stay aligned to the development of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSObut they do not 
contribute directly into the code can use a mirrored version of the repository 
done using <TT>git</TT>, available on <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>. Please apply for an account on 
the portal if you haven't one (see Sect.<A HREF="#SubSec:qeforge">3.1</A> for details) then 
contact support[.at.]qe-forge.org for authorization (remember to explain  what 
you need and why). Once the access is set, tadd a public SSH key on QE-FORGE and 
then check out the repository using this command:
<PRE>
   git clone ssh://username@qeforge.qe-forge.org/gitroot/q-e-private
</PRE>

<P>
This repository is only for pull operation and it is "one-way" repository,
meaning it is kept automatically aligned by a script with the SVN repository.
Committing into this GIT mirror does not produce a commit in the SVN. See 
Sect.<A HREF="#Sec:git">12</A>, ``Using git'', for more instructions on how to 
use <TT>git</TT>.
<BR>
<P>
If your project involves a major new addition (e.g. a new package), 
consider registering it as a new <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>project, with a separate 
SVN or (better) <TT>git</TT> repository. It is possible to keep the 
project private, or to restrict access to selected Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSOdevelopers.
<BR>
<P>
<EM>Important:</EM> if you closely develop to Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSOthen keep your copy of the 
distribution aligned to the SVN. Don't work for years, or even for months, 
without keeping an eye to what is going on in the SVN or in the mirrored GIT 
repository. This is especially true for projects that are ``tightly bound'' 
to Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, that is, use Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO code and routines. Frequently update your copy 
(using command <TT>svn update</TT> or <TT>git pull</TT>), verify if changes 
made meanwhile by other developers conflict with your changes.
Conflicts are in most cases easy to solve: see Sect. <A HREF="#SubSec:Conflicts">11.2</A> 
for hints on how to remove conflicts and on how to figure out what went wrong.

<P>
If instead your project is ``loosely coupled'', that is, it just uses the
Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO installation procedure and/or data files, it is less likely to run
into problems, since major incompatible changes are quite rare.
You may still need to verify from time to time that everything keeps
working. though.

3.4 Hints, Caveats, Do's and Dont's for developers</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Before doing anything, inquire whether it is already there,
or under development. In particular, check (and update) the "Road Map"
page <TT>www.quantum-espresso.org/road-map</TT>, send a message to
<TT>q-e-developers</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>Before starting writing code, inquire whether you can reuse
code that is already available in the distribution. Avoid redundancy:
<EM>the only bug-free software line is the one that doesn't exist</EM>
(citation adapted from Henry Ford).
</LI>
<LI>When you make some changes:

<UL>
<LI>Check that are not spoiling other people's work. In particular,
search the distribution for codes using the routine or module you are
modifying and change its usage or its calling arguments everywhere.
Use the commit message to notify all developers if you introduce any
``dangerous'' change (i.e. susceptible to break some features or
packages, including external packages using Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO).
</LI>
<LI>Do not forget that your changes must work on many different
combinations of hardware and software, in both serial and parallel execution.
</LI>
<LI>Do not forget that your changes must work for a wide variety of
different case: if you implement something that works only in some
selected cases, that's ok, as long as the code stops (or at least,
issues a warning) in all other cases. There is something worse than
no results: wrong results.
</LI>
<LI>Do not forget that your changes must work on systems of wildly
different computational size: a piece of code that works fine for
crystal silicon may gobble a disproportionate amount of time and/or
memory in a 1000-atom cell.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Document your contributions:

<UL>
<LI>If you modify what a code can do, or introduce
incompatibilities with previous versions (e.g. old data file
no longer readable, old input no longer valid), <EM>please</EM>
report it in file <TT>Doc/release-notes</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>If you add/modify/remove input variables, document
it in the appropriate
<TT>INPUT_*.def</TT> file; if
you remove an input variable, update tests and examples
accordingly.
</LI>
<LI>All newly introduced features or variables must be
accompanied by an example or a test or both (either a
new one or a modified existing test or example).
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Please do not include files (any kind, including
pseudopotential files) with DOS ^M characters or
tabulators ^I.
</LI>
<LI>When you modify the program sources, run the
<TT>install/makedeps.sh</TT>  script  or type <TT>make depend</TT>
to update files <TT>make.depend</TT> in the various
subdirectories. These files are under SVN as well;
if modified they should be committed.

3.5 Guidelines for reporting bugs</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="SubSec:Bugs"></A>
<UL>
<LI>Before deciding that a problem is due to a bug in the codes,
verify if it is reproducible on different machines/architectures/phases
of the moon: erratic or irreproducible problems, especially in parallel
execution, are often an indication of buggy compilers or libraries
</LI>
<LI>Bug reports should preferably be filed using the bug tracking
facility at <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>:
<BR><TT>http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e/tracker</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Bug reports should include enough information to be reproduced:
the error message alone is seldom a sufficient piece of information.
Typically, one should report

<UL>
<LI>version number, hardware/software combination(s) for which
     the problem arises
</LI>
<LI>whether it happens in serial or parallel execution or both
(if in parallel only, how executed),
</LI>
<LI>an output for a test case showing the presumed bug
</LI>
<LI>all the needed info and data to re-run the test case showing
the bug

Stable releases (until v.5.4) are labelled as <I>N</I>.<I>M</I>.<I>p</I>, where <I>N</I>=major,
<I>M</I>=minor, <I>p</I>=bugfix. The logic goes more or less as follows:

<UL>
<LI><EM>Major</EM>: when something really important changes, e.g.

</LI>
<LI><EM>Bugfix</EM>: only bug fixes; occasionally, minor new functionalities

It may be convenient to make a SVN branch at release <I>N</I>.<I>M</I>.0: this allows
to go on with the development while keeping track of bug fixes.

Since release 5.2 (June 20, 2015), stable release are packaged at
fixed dates. The initial schedule is a release every three to four months.
Since v.5.4 bugfix releases are no longer packaged.

<P>
Releases are stored to <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>. Given the size of the complete distribution,
the release is split into a ``core'' distribution and ``add-ons'',
additional packages, that can be downloaded and installed on demand
from the core distribution. ``External'' packages can be independently
released, as long as there is no compatibility problem.

<P>
The automatic downloading of packages is implemented in file
<TT>install/plugins_makefile</TT> and configured in file
<TT>install/plugins_list</TT>. For independently released packages,
it is sufficient to update links. For add-ons packages, not contained
in the core distribution, there is however a catch-22:
the core distribution must know the link to all packages it downloads,
but these are known only <EM>after</EM> such packages are uploaded to
<TT>qe-forge.org</TT> (and the only way to discover the exact link is to go over
the released package with the mouse).
The workaround is that the core distribution looks for generic names,
written in file <TT>install/plugins_list</TT>. These names are translated
by <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> into specific names. After all packages have been uploaded,
file <TT>/var/lib/gforge/archives/index.php</TT>, residing on <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>,
must be edited and links updated. This requires system privileges on
the machine hosting <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>.

5 Structure of the distribution</A>
</H1>

<P>
Since v.5, the directory structure of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO reflects its organization
into packages. Each package is stored into a specific subdirectory.
In addition, there is a set of directories, common to all packages,
containing common code,
libraries, installation utilities, general documentation.

<P>
Common files and directories in the <TT>espresso/</TT> directory are:
<PRE>
   install/                 configure
   include/                 make.inc
   archive/                 Makefile
   dev-tools/               License
   pseudo/                  README
   Doc/                     environment_variables
   clib/                    bin/
   Modules/                 LR_Modules/
   COUPLE/                  upftools/
</PRE>
Apart from  <TT>License</TT> and <TT>README</TT> whose meaning is
obvious, the other files and directories are related to

<UL>
<LI><EM>Installation</EM> (i.e. compilation and linking):
<BR><TT>install/</TT>, <TT>dev-tools/</TT>, <TT>archive/</TT>,
<TT>configure</TT>, .inc
</LI>
<LI><EM>Testing</EM> (running tests and examples):
<BR><TT>pseudo/</TT>, <TT>environment_variables</TT>
</LI>
<LI><EM>General documentation</EM> (not package-specific):
<TT>Doc/</TT>
</LI>
<LI><EM>C and Fortran Libraries, modules</EM>:
<TT>clib/</TT>, <TT>Modules/</TT>, <TT>COUPLE/</TT>
(the latter contains code and documentation useful to call Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO programs
 from external codes)
</LI>
<LI><EM>Linear-response specific modules</EM>:
<TT>LR_Modules/</TT>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The core distribution also  contains the three package-specific directories
<TT>PW/</TT>, <TT>PP/</TT>, <TT>CPV/</TT>, for
 <TT>PWscf</TT>, <TT>PostProc</TT>, <TT>CP</TT>, respectively.
Typical subdirectory structure of a directory containing a package
(e.g. <TT>PW/</TT>):
<PRE>
   Makefile
   examples/

5.1.1 Preprocessing</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="SubSec:CPP"></A>Fortran-95 source code contains preprocessing option with
the same syntax used by the C preprocessor <TT>cpp</TT>.
Most F95 compilers understand preprocessing options <TT>-D ...</TT>
or some similar form. Some compilers however do not support
or do not implement properly preprocessing. In this case the
preprocessing is done using <TT>cpp</TT>.
Normally, <TT>configure</TT> takes care of this, by selecting the
appropriate rule <TT>@f90rule@</TT> below, in this section
of file <TT>make.inc.in</TT>:
<PRE>
.f90.o:
	@f90rule@
</PRE>
and producing the appropriate file .inc.

<P>
Preprocessing is useful to

<UL>
<LI>account for machine dependency in a unified source tree
</LI>
<LI>distinguish between parallel and serial execution when they
follow different paths (i.e. there is a substantial difference between
serial execution and parallel execution on a single processor)
</LI>
<LI>introduce experimental or special-purpose stuff

<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> <TT>include/f_defs.h</TT> is obsolete and
must not be used any longer.

<P>
The following capabilities of the C preprocessor are used:

<UL>
<LI>assign a value to a given expression. For instance, command
  <TT>#define THIS that</TT>, or the option in the command line:
  <TT>-DTHIS=that</TT>, will replace all occurrences of <TT>THIS</TT>
  with <TT>that</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>include file (command <TT>#include</TT>)
</LI>
<LI>expand macros (command <TT>#define</TT>)
</LI>
<LI>execute conditional expressions such as
<PRE>
  #if defined (__expression)
    ...code A...
  #else
    ...code B...
  #endif

If <TT>__expression</TT> is defined (with a <TT>#define</TT> command

then  <TT>...code A...</TT> is sent to output; otherwise
<TT>...code B...</TT> is sent to output.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
In order to make  preprocessing options
easy to see, preprocessing variables should start with
two underscores, as <TT>__expression</TT> in the above

5.1.2 How to edit the <TT>configure</TT> script</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="SubSec:conf"></A>The <TT>configure</TT> script is generated from its source file
<TT>configure.ac</TT> by the GNU <TT>autoconf</TT> utility
(<TT>http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/</TT>).  Don't edit <TT>configure</TT> directly: whenever it gets regenerated, your changes will be lost.
Instead, go to the <TT>install/</TT> directory, edit <TT>configure.ac</TT> and/or
files <TT>install/mt/*.m4</TT>, then run <TT>autoconf</TT> to regenerate <TT>configure</TT>.
If you want to keep the old <TT>configure</TT>, make a copy first.

<P>
GNU <TT>autoconf</TT> is installed by default on most Unix/Linux systems.  If
you don't have it on your system, you'll have to install it. You will
need a recent version (e.g. v.2.65) of <TT>autoconf</TT>, because our
<TT>configure.ac</TT> file uses recent syntax.

<P>
<TT>configure.ac</TT> is a regular Bourne shell script (i.e., "sh" - not csh!),
except that:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>capitalized names starting with "AC_" are <TT>autoconf</TT>   macros.  Normally you shouldn't have to touch them.
</DD>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>square brackets are normally removed by the macro processor.
  If you need a square bracket (that should be very rare), you'll have
  to write two.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
You may refer to the GNU <TT>autoconf</TT> Manual for more info.

<P>
<TT>make.inc.in</TT> is the source file for .inc, that
<TT>configure</TT> generates: you might want to edit that file as well.
The generation procedure is as follows: if <TT>configure.ac</TT> contains the macro
"AC_SUBST(name)", then every occurrence of "@name@" in the source
file will be substituted with the value of the shell variable "name"
at the point where AC_SUBST was called.

<P>
Similarly, <TT>configure.msg</TT> is generated from <TT>configure.msg.in</TT>: this
file is only used by <TT>configure</TT> to print its final report, and isn't
needed for the compilation.  We did it this way so that our
<TT>configure</TT> may also be used by other projects, just by replacing the
Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO-specific <TT>configure.msg.in</TT> by your own.

<P>
<TT>configure</TT> writes a detailed log of its operation to <TT>config.log</TT>.
When any configuration step fails, you may look there for the relevant

5.1.3 How to add support for a new architecture</A>
</H3>

<P>
In order to support a previously unsupported architecture, first you
have to figure out which compilers, compilation flags, libraries
etc. should be used on that architecture.
In other words, you have to write a .inc that works: you may use
the manual configuration procedure for that (see the
User Guide).  Then, you have to modify <TT>configure</TT> so that it can
generate that .inc automatically.

<P>
To do that, you have to add the case for your architecture in several
places throughout <TT>configure.ac</TT>:

<OL>
<LI>Detect architecture

<P>
Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  if test "$arch" = ""
  then
          case $host in
                  ia64-*-linux-gnu )      arch=ia64   ;;
                  x86_64-*-linux-gnu )    arch=x86_64 ;;
                  *-pc-linux-gnu )        arch=ia32   ;;
                  etc.
</PRE>
Here you must add an entry corresponding to your architecture and
operating system.  Run <TT>config.guess</TT> to obtain the string identifying
your system.
For instance on a PC it may be "i686-pc-linux-gnu", while on IBM SP4
"powerpc-ibm-aix5.1.0.0".  It is convenient to put some asterisks to
account for small variations of the string for different machines of
the same family.  For instance, it could be "aix4.3" instead of
"aix5.1", or "athlon" instead of "i686"...

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Select compilers

<P>
Look for these lines:

<P>
<PRE>
  # candidate compilers and flags based on architecture
  case $arch in
  ia64 | x86_64 )
        ...
  ia32 )
        ...
  aix )
        ...
  etc.
</PRE>

<P>
Add an entry for your value of $arch, and set there the appropriate
values for several variables, if needed (all variables are assigned
some reasonable default value, defined before the "case" block):

<P>
- "try_f90" should contain the list of candidate Fortran 90 compilers,
in order of decreasing preference (i.e. configure will use the first
it finds).  If your system has parallel compilers, you should list
them in "try_mpif90".

<P>
- "try_ar", "try_arflags": for these, the values "ar" and "ruv" should
be always fine, unless some special flag is required (e.g., -X64
With sp4).

<P>
- you should define "try_dflags" if there is any preprocessing
option specific to your machine: for instance, on IBM machines,
"try_dflags=-D__AIX" . A list of such flags can be found in file
<TT>include/defs.h.README</TT>.

<P>
You shouldn't need to define the following:
- "try_iflags" should be set to the appropriate "-I" option(s)
needed by the preprocessor or by the compiler to locate *.h files
to be included; try_iflags="-I../include" should be good for most cases

<P>
For example, here's the entry for IBM machines running AIX:
<PRE>
   aix )
        try_mpif90="mpxlf90_r mpxlf90"
        try_f90="xlf90_r xlf90 $try_f90"
        try_arflags="-X64 ruv"
        try_arflags_dynamic="-X64 ruv"
        try_dflags="-D__AIX -D__XLF"
        ;;
</PRE>
The following step is to look for both serial and parallel fortran
compilers:
<PRE>
  # check serial Fortran 90 compiler...
  ...
  AC_PROG_F77($f90)
  ...
        # check parallel Fortran 90 compiler
  ...
        AC_PROG_F77($mpif90)
  ...
  echo setting F90... $f90
  echo setting MPIF90... $mpif90
</PRE>
A few compilers require some extra work here: for instance, if the
Intel Fortran compiler was selected, you need to know which version
because different versions need different flags.

<P>
At the end of the test,

<P>
- $mpif90 is the parallel compiler, if any; if no parallel compiler
  is found or if <TT>-disable-parallel</TT> was specified, $mpif90
  is the serial compiler

<P>
- $f90 is the serial compiler

<P>
Next step: the choice of (serial) C and Fortran 77 compilers.
Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  # candidate C and f77 compilers good for all cases
  try_cc="cc gcc"
  try_f77="$f90"

  case "$arch:$f90" in
  *:f90 )
        ....
  etc.
</PRE>
Here you have to add an entry for your architecture, and since the
correct choice of C and f77 compilers may depend on the fortran-90
compiler, you may need to specify the f90 compiler as well.
Again, specify the compilers in try_cc and try_f77 in order of
decreasing preference.  At the end of the test,

<P>
- $cc is the C compiler

<P>
- $f77 is the Fortran 77 compiler, used to compile *.f files
(may coincide with $f90)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Specify compilation flags.

<P>
Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  # check Fortran compiler flags
  ...
  case "$arch:$f90" in
  ia64:ifort* | x86_64:ifort* )
        ...
  ia64:ifc* )
        ...

Add an entry for your case and define:

<P>
- "try_fflags": flags for Fortran 77 compiler.

<P>
- "try_f90flags": flags for Fortran 90 compiler.
In most cases they will be the same as in Fortran 77 plus some
others.  In that case, define them as "$(FFLAGS) -something_else".

<P>
- "try_fflags_noopt": flags for Fortran 77 with all optimizations
turned off: this is usually "-O0".
These flags used to be needed to compile flib/dlamch.f; likely obsolete

<P>
- "try_ldflags": flags for the linking phase (not including the list
of libraries: this is decided later).

<P>
- "try_ldflags_static": additional flags to select static compilation
(i.e., don't use shared libraries).

<P>
- "try_dflags": must be defined if there is in the code any preprocessing
option specific to your compiler (for instance, -D__INTEL for Intel
compilers).  Define it as "$try_dflags -D..." so that pre-existing
flags, if any, are preserved.

<P>
- if the Fortran 90 compiler is not able to invoke the C preprocessor
automatically before compiling, set "have_cpp=0" (the opposite case
is the default). The appropriate compilation rules will be generated
accordingly. If the compiler requires that any flags be specified in
order to invoke the preprocessor (for example, "-fpp " - note the
space), specify them in "pre_fdflags".

<P>
For example, here's the entry for ifort on Linux PC:
<PRE>
  ia32:ifort* )
          try_fflags="-O2 -tpp6 -assume byterecl"
          try_f90flags="\$(FFLAGS) -nomodule"
          try_fflags_noopt="-O0 -assume byterecl"
          try_ldflags=""
          try_ldflags_static="-static"
          try_dflags="$try_dflags -D__INTEL"
          pre_fdflags="-fpp "
          ;;
</PRE>
Next step: flags for the C compiler. Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  case "$arch:$cc" in
  *:icc )
        ...
  *:pgcc )
        ...
  etc.
</PRE>
Add an entry for your case and define:

<P>
- "try_cflags": flags for C compiler.

<P>
- "c_ldflags": flags for linking, when using the C compiler as linker.
This is needed to check for libraries written in C, such as FFTW.

<P>
- if you need a different preprocessor from the standard one ($CC -E),
define it in "try_cpp".

<P>
For example for XLC on AIX:
<PRE>
  aix:mpcc* | aix:xlc* | aix:cc )
          try_cflags="-q64 -O2"
          c_ldflags="-q64"
          ;;
</PRE>
Finally, if you have to use a nonstandard preprocessor, look for these
lines:
<PRE>
  echo $ECHO_N "setting CPPFLAGS... $ECHO_C"
  case $cpp in
        cpp) try_cppflags="-P -traditional" ;;
        fpp) try_cppflags="-P"              ;;
        ...
</PRE>
and set "try_cppflags" as appropriate.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Search for libraries

<P>
To instruct <TT>configure</TT> to search for libraries, you must tell it two
things: the names of libraries it should search for, and where it
should search.

<P>
The following libraries are searched for:

<P>
- BLAS or equivalent.
Some vendor replacements for BLAS that are supported by Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
MKL on Linux, 32- and 64-bit Intel CPUs
<BR>
ACML on Linux, 64-bit AMD CPUs
<BR>
ESSL on AIX
<BR>
SCSL on sgi altix
<BR>
SUNperf on sparc

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Moreover, ATLAS is used over BLAS if available.

<P>
- LAPACK or equivalent. Some vendor replacements for LAPACK are supported
  by Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, e.g.: Intel MKL, IBM ESSL

<P>
- FFTW (version 3) or another supported FFT library (e.g Intel DFTI,
  IBM ESSL)

<P>
- the IBM MASS vector math library

<P>
- an MPI library. This is often automatically linked by the compiler

<P>
If you have another replacement for the above libraries, you'll have
to insert a new entry in the appropriate place.

<P>
This is unfortunately a little bit too complex to explain.
Basic info: 
<BR>"AC_SEARCH_LIBS(function, name, ...)" looks for symbol
"function" in library "libname.a".  If that is found, "-lname" is
appended to the LIBS environment variable (initially empty).
The real thing is more complicated than just that because the
"-Ldirectory" option must be added to search in a nonstandard
directory, and because a given library may require other libraries as
prerequisites (for example, Lapack requires BLAS).

Subdirectory <TT>clib/</TT> contains libraries written in C

See <TT>Modules/wrappers.f90</TT> for inspiration and examples.
Reference documentation can be found for instance here:

</LI>
<LI><TT>F77_FUNC_(f_nc,F_NC)</TT> for function <TT>f_nc</TT>,

</LI>
</OL>
These macros are defined in file <TT>include/c_defs.h</TT>,
included by all <TT>*.c</TT> files, and are automagically
generated by <TT>configure</TT>. The goal of these macros is to

The two main packages, <TT>PWscf</TT> and <TT>CP</TT>, support

Restarting is much more complicated in  <TT>PWscf</TT>. Since v.5.1.
restarting from interrupted calculations is possible ONLY if the code

restart from any possible case, such as e.g. crashes. This would
imply saving lots of data all the time. With modern machines, this is
not a good idea. Restart in  <TT>PWscf</TT> currently works as follows:

<UL>
<LI>Each loop calls <TT>check_stop_now</TT> just before the end.

8 Parallelization (MPI)</A>
</H1>

<P>
In MPI parallelization, a number of independent processes are started
on as many processors, communicating via calls to MPI libraries
(the code will work even with more than one process per processor,
but this is not a smart thing to do). Each process has its own
set of variables and knows nothing about other processes' variables.
Variables that take little memory are replicated on all processors,
those that take a lot of memory (wavefunctions, G-vectors, R-space grid)
are distributed.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00091000000000000000">
8.1 General rules</A>
</H2>

<P>
Calls to MPI libraries should be confined to a few selected places,
not scattered everywhere into the source code. The vast majority
of parallel operations consist either in broadcasts from one processor
to all others, or in global operations: parallel sums and transpose.
All you need is the MPI communicator (plus the ID of the root processor
for broadcasts), and the appropriate call to wrapper routines, contained
in <TT>espresso/Modules/mp.f90</TT> and <TT>espresso/Modules/mp_base.f90</TT>.
For instance: <TT>mp_sum</TT> is a wrapper to <TT>mpi_reduce</TT>,
<TT>mp_bcast</TT> to <TT>mpi_bcast</TT>.

<P>
For efficiency reasons (latency is very significant), performing many
parallel operations on a small amount of data each must be avoided.
If you can, store a sizable amount of data and transmit it in a single
MPI call. An example of REALLY BAD code:
<PRE>
   COMPLEX, ALLOCATABLE :: wfc(:,:), swfc(:,:)
   ALLOCATE (wfc(npwx,m),swfc(npwx,m))
   DO i=1,m
      DO j=1,m
         ps = zdotc(npw,wfc(1,i),1,swfc(1,j)1)
         CALL mp_sum(ps,intra_bgrp_group)
      END DO
   END DO
</PRE>
MUCH better code, both for serial and parallel speed:
<PRE>
   COMPLEX, ALLOCATABLE :: ps(:,:), wfc(:,:), swfc(:,:)
   ALLOCATE (ps(m,m), wfc(npwx,m),swfc(npwx,m))
   CALL zgemm ('c', 'n', m, m, npw, (1.d0, 0.d0), wfc, &amp;

should not be used in source code, unless this is used only by
stand-alone executables that perform simple auxiliary tasks
and do not allow for  multiple parallelization levels.
Unless QE is started from an external code, <TT>world_comm</TT>

<TT>mp_image.f90</TT> is the module containing information about
``image" parallelization, i.e. division into quasi-independent similar
calculations, each taking care of a different set of atomic
positions (NEB, PWscf) or of different irreps/phonon wavevectors
(PHonon). <TT>intra_image_comm</TT> is the communicator between
processors of the same image (most of the action will happen here);
<TT>inter_image_comm</TT> is the communicator between processors
belonging to different images (should be used only when communication
between images is necessary).
<TT>intra_image_comm</TT> and <TT>world_comm</TT> coincide if there
is just one image running.

<P>
<TT>mp_pools.f90</TT> is the module containing information about k-point
(``pool") parallelization. <TT>intra_pool_comm</TT> is the communicator
between processors working on the same group (``pool") of k-points;
<TT>inter_pool_comm</TT> is the communicator between different
k-point pools. Note that:

8.3 Tricks and pitfalls</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Replicated calculations may either be performed independently on
each processor, or performed on one processor and broadcast to all
others. The first approach requires less programming, but it is unsafe:
in principle all processors should yield exactly the same results, if
they work on the same data, but sometimes they don't (depending on the
machine, compiler, and libraries). Even a tiny difference in the last
significant digit can eventually cause serious trouble if allowed to
 build up, especially when a replicated check is performed (in which
case the code may ''hang'' if the check yields different results on
different processors). Never assume that the value of a variable produced
by replicated calculations is exactly the same on all processors: when in
doubt, broadcast the value calculated on a specific processor (the ''root''
processor) to all others.
</LI>
<LI>Routine <TT>errore</TT> should be called in parallel by all processors,
or else it will hang
</LI>
<LI>I/O operations: file opening, closing, and so on, are as a rule performed
only on processor <TT>ionode</TT>. The correct way to check for errors is
the following:
<PRE>
IF ( ionode ) THEN
   OPEN ( ..., IOSTAT=ierr )
   ...
END IF
CALL mp_bcast( ierr, ... , intra_image_comm )
CALL errore( 'routine','error', ierr )
</PRE>
The same applies to all operations performed on a single processor,
or a subgroup of processors: any error code must be broadcast before
the check.

8.4 Data distribution</A>
</H2>

<P>
Quantum ESPRESSO employ arrays whose memory requirements fall
into three categories.

<UL>
<LI><EM>Fully Scalable</EM>:
Arrays that are distributed across processors of a pool.
Fully scalable arrays are typically large to very large and contain one
of the following dimensions:

<UL>
<LI>number of plane waves, npw (or max number, npwx)
</LI>
<LI>number of Gvectors, ngm
</LI>
<LI>number of grid points in the R space, dfft%nnr
</LI>
</UL>
Their size decreases linearly with the number of processors in a pool.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Partially Scalable</EM>:
Arrays that are distributed across processors of the
ortho or diag group. Typically they are much smaller than fully scalable
array, and small in absolute terms for moderate-size system. Their size
however increases quadratically with the number of atoms in the system,
so they have to be distributed for large systems (hundreds to thousands
atoms). Partially scalable arrays contain none of the dimensions listed
above, two of the following dimensions:

<UL>
<LI>number of states, nbnd
</LI>
<LI>number of atomic states, natomwfc
</LI>
<LI>number of projectors, nkb
</LI>
</UL>
Their size decreases linearly with the number of processors in a ortho
or diag group.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Nonscalable</EM>: All the remaining arrays, that are not distributed across
processors. These are typically small arrays, having dimensions like for
instance:

<UL>
<LI>number of atoms, nat
</LI>
<LI>number of species of atoms, nsp
</LI>
</UL>
The size of these arrays is independent on the number of processors.
</LI>

The "restart file" is actually a "restart directory", containing
several files and sub-directories. For CP/FPMD, the restart directory
is created as "$prefix_$ndw/", where $prefix is the value of the
variable "prefix". $ndw the value of variable ndw, both read in
input; it is read from "$prefix_$ndr/", where $ndr the value of
variable ndr, read from input. For PWscf, both input and output
directories are called "$prefix.save/".

<P>
The content of the restart directory is as follows:
<PRE>
data-file.xml          which contains:
                       - general information that doesn't require large data set:
                         atomic structure, lattice, k-points, symmetries,

                         data: grids, wavefunctions, charge density, potentials, ...

charge_density.dat     contains the charge density
spin_polarization.dat  contains the spin polarization (rhoup-rhodw) (LSDA case)
magnetization.x.dat
magnetization.y.dat    contain the spin polarization along x,y,z
magnetization.z.dat    (noncollinear calculations)
lambda.dat             contains occupations (Car-Parrinello dynamics only)
mat_z.1                contains occupations (ensemble-dynamics only)

&lt;pseudopotentials&gt;     A copy of all pseudopotential files given in input

&lt;k-point dirs&gt;         Subdirectories K00001/, K00002/, etc, one per k-point.

10.1 Programming style (or lack of it)</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are currently no strict guidelines for developers. You
should however follow at least the following loose ones:

<UL>
<LI>Preprocessing options should be capitalized and start with
two underscores. Examples: __MPI, __LINUX, ... Use 
preprocessing syntax <code>#if defined (XXX)</code>, not <code>#if defined XXX</code>
or <code>#ifdef XXX</code>
</LI>
<LI>Fortran commands should be capitalized:
CALL something( )
</LI>
<LI>Variable names should be lowercase: <TT>foo = bar/2</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Indent DO's and IF's with three white spaces (editors like emacs will do this automatically for you)
</LI>
<LI>Do not write crammed code: leave spaces, insert empty separation lines
</LI>
<LI>Use comments (introduced by a !) to explain what is not obvious from
the code. Remember that what is obvious to you may not be obvious to other
people. It is especially important to document what a routine does, what
it needs on input, what it produces on output. A few words of comment
may save hours of searching into the code for a piece of missing information.
</LI>
<LI>do not use machine-dependent extensions or sloppy syntax. An example:
Standard f90
requires that a &amp; is needed both at end of line AND at the beginning of
continuation line if there is a character variable (inside ' ' or " ")
spanning two lines. Some compilers do not complain if the latter &amp; is
missing, others do.
</LI>
<LI>use "dp" (defined in module ''kinds'') to define the type of real and complex variables
</LI>
<LI>all constants should be defined to be of kind "dp".  Preferred syntax: 0.0_dp.
</LI>
<LI>use "generic" intrinsic functions: SIN, COS, etc.
</LI>
<LI>conversions should be explicitely indicated. For conversions to real,
use DBLE, or else REAL(...,KIND=dp). For conversions to complex, use
CMPLX(...,...,KIND=dp). For complex conjugate, use CONJG.  For imaginary part,
use AIMAG.  IMPORTANT: Do not use REAL or CMPLX without KIND=dp, or else you
will lose precision (except when you take the real part of a
double precision complex number).
</LI>
<LI>Do not use automatic arrays (e.g. <TT>REAL(dp) :: A(N)</TT> with
<TT>N</TT> defined at run time) unless you are sure that the array is
small in all cases: large arrays may easily exceed the stack size,
or the memory size,
</LI>
<LI>Do not use pointers unless you have a good reason to:
pointers may hinder optimization. Allocatable arrays should be used instead.
</LI>
<LI>If you use pointers, nullify them before performing tests on their
status.
</LI>
<LI>Beware fancy constructs like structures: they look great on paper,
but they also have the potential to make a code unreadable, or inefficient,
or unusable with some compilers. Avoid nested structures unless you have a
valid reason to use them.
</LI>
<LI>Be careful with F90 array syntax and in particular with
array sections. Passing an array section to a routine may look elegant
but it may turn out to be inefficient: a copy will be silently done
if the section is not contiguous in memory (or if the compiler
decides it is the right thing to do), increasing the memory footprint.
</LI>
<LI>Do not pass unallocated arrays as arguments, even in those cases where
they are not actually used inside the subroutine: some compilers don't
like it.
</LI>
<LI>Do not use any construct that is susceptible to be flagged as
out-of-bounds error, even if no actual out-of-bound error takes place.
</LI>
<LI>Always use IMPLICIT NONE and declare all local variables.
All variables passed as arguments to a routine should be declared as
INTENT (IN), (OUT), or (INOUT). All variables from modules should be
explicitly specified via USE module, ONLY : variable. Variables used
in an array declaration must be declared first, as in the following
example:
<PRE>
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN)   :: N
    REAL(dp), INTENT(OUT) :: A(N)
</PRE>
in this order (some compilers complain if you put the second line
before the first).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000112000000000000000">
10.2 Adding or modifying input variables</A>
</H2>

<P>
New input variables should be added to
''Modules/input_parameters.f90'',
then copied to the code internal variables in the ''input.f90''
subroutine. The namelists and cards parsers are in
''Modules/read_namelists.f90'' and ''Modules/read_cards.f90''.
Files ''input_parameters.f90'', ''read_namelists.f90'',
''read_cards.f90'' are shared by all codes, while each code
has its own version of ''input.f90''  used to copy input values
into internal variables

<P>
EXAMPLE:
suppose you need to add a new input variable called ''pippo''
to the namelist control, then:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>add pippo to the input_parameters.f90 file containing the
namelist control
<PRE>
              INTEGER :: pippo = 0
              NAMELIST / control / ....., pippo
</PRE>
Remember: always set an initial value!

<P>
</LI>
<LI>add pippo to the control_default subroutine (contained in
module read_namelists.f90 )
<PRE>
               subroutine control_default( prog )
              ...
              IF( prog == 'PW' ) pippo = 10
              ...
              end subroutine
</PRE>
This routine sets the default value for pippo (can be different in
different codes)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>add pippo to the control_bcast subroutine (contained in module
read_namelists.f90 )
 <PRE>
                subroutine control_bcast( )
                ...
                call mp_bcast( pippo, intra_image_comm )

11 Using SVN
</H1>
Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSOis maintained in a Subversion (SVN) repository. Developers can have
read-write access when needed, read-only otherwise. Note that the latest
(development) version may occasionally not work properly: carefully
verify the results before using it in production work.

<P>
Subversion, also known as SVN, is a software that allows many
developers to work and maintain a single copy of a software in a
central location (repository).
It is installed by default on many Unix machines, or otherwise
it can be very easily installed.
For the end user, SVN is rather similar to CVS:
if no advanced features are used, the basic commands are the same.
More information on SVN can be found here:
<TT>http://subversion.apache.org/</TT>.

<P>
Current organization:

<UL>
<LI><EM>trunk</EM>: development goes on here
</LI>
<LI><EM>branches</EM>: major new developments, disruptive changes, very
experimental features, things that have a long time before being released
(if ever) ...
</LI>
<LI><EM>external</EM>: packages that are be developed in a separate SVN trunk
can be downloaded into the main QE trunk - access may be restricted to
specific (usually expert) developers.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Follow the instructions in
<TT>http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e/scmsvn</TT>,
under `Access Info'',
to check out (i.e.  download) the SVN repository.
The distribution will appear in directory <TT>trunk/espresso/</TT>.
Branches (i.e. sub-versions) will appear as separate directories.

<P>
<EM>Important notice: since v.5.3 the SVN repository is no longer accessible
read-only to everybody.</EM>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000121000000000000000">
11.1 SVN operations</A>
</H2>

<P>
To update the code to the current version:
<PRE>
  svn update
</PRE>
in the directory containing the distribution.
To see the difference between the current version and your modified
copy:
<PRE>
  svn diff
</PRE>
To save your modified version into the repository:
(read-write access only):
<PRE>
  svn commit
</PRE>
Please explain in a few words what your commit is about! Use option
<TT>-m"comment"</TT> or the editor of your choice (set it using the
<TT>SVN_EDITOR</TT> environment variable).
If you want to add a new file, or a new directory, before commiting
give command
<PRE>
  svn add
</PRE>
To remove a file/directory (if empty):
<PRE>
  svn delete
</PRE>
You can move a file (a directory, a group of files, ...) into a different
directory using command
<PRE>
  svn mv dir1/file1 [dir1/file2 ...] dir2/
</PRE>
or, if you prefer to make a copy of the file, retaining the history:
<PRE>
svn cp svn+ssh://myusername@qeforge.qe-forge.org/svnroot/q-e/trunk/espresso/DIR1/file.1 svn+ssh://myusername@qeforge.qe-forge.org/svnroot/q-e/trunk/espresso/DIR2/file2
</PRE>
then run <TT>svn update</TT> to have it applied locally.
After such operations are done, run the <TT>install/makedeps.sh</TT> script
or type <TT>make depend</TT> to update files <TT>make.depend</TT> in the
various subdirectories. It is preferrable to commit the moved files/modified
directories and the affected Makefiles/make.depend in a single command.

11.2 Removing conflicts
</H2>
When you update your working copy of the repository,
you may encounter two types of conflicts:

<OL>
<LI>Somebody else has changed the same lines that you have
      modified.
</LI>
<LI>Somebody else has changed something that has broken one
      or more functionalities of your modified version.
</LI>
</OL>
Here we are concerned with kind 1. of conflicts, those that
are noticed by SVN and produce, in addition to a message with
a "C" in the first column before the conflicting file name:

<UL>
<LI><TT>conflicting-file</TT> containing an attempted merge
of your version with the SVN version, with conflicting sections
indicated by
<PRE>
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
     (your version)
   =======
     (SVN version)
   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI><TT>conflicting-file.mine</TT> containing your version
</LI>
<LI>two <TT>conflicting-file.rXXXXX</TT> containing the two most
recent versions (<TT>XXXXX</TT> is the revision number) in SVN.
</LI>
</UL>
Look into the conflicting section(s): in most cases, conflicts are trivial
(format changes, white spaces) or easily solved (the part of the code you
were modifying has been moved to another place, or a variable has meanwhilke
changed name, for instance). Edit <TT>conflicting-file</TT>, remove all other
copies of <TT>conflicting-file.*</TT>, commit.

<P>
Sometimes, the conflict is not so easy to solve. In this case, you
can selectively update your repository at a given date, or at a given
revision number, using command (XXXXX=revision number)
<PRE>
  svn update -r XXXXX
</PRE>
You can also select a date, using {"date"} instead of the revision number.
In this way you can locate which change(s) is (are) the culprit(s).
The web-SVN interface:
<PRE>
   http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e/scmsvn
</PRE>
will also be very helpful in locating the problem.
Of course, communication with other developers will also help.
The above paragraph applies as well to case 2. os conflicts, in
presence or in absence of explicit SVN conflicts. If the reason for
malfunctioning is not evident, you have to figure out when the
problem started. Once this is done, itis usually straightforward
to figure out why.

11.3 Merging branch and trunk
</H2>
Let us assume that you have created a branch and that you are working
in the directory of your branch. The simplest way to keep it aligned
with the trunk is the following command:
<PRE>
  svn merge ^/trunk/espresso
</PRE>
The caret (<TT>^</TT>) syntax is a shorthand for the entire URL of the trunk.
Then you have to remove conflicts that can arise from incompatible changes
made in the trunk. Then you can commit your "aligned" branch (beware:
the commit message is very large in size if you haven't merged recently;
if so, it may never reach the <TT>q-e-commits</TT> mailing list).

<P>
In order to merge a branch back into the trunk, the simplest procedure is
to align first the branch with the trunk and commit it, as above; then,
in a clean, not locally modified, trunk:
<PRE>
  svn merge --reintegrate ^/branches/my-espresso-branch
</PRE>
then, commit.

<P>
Note the following very useful property: SVN can merge anything with anything!
The following web page may be useful:

11.4 Including a repository into the trunk
</H2>
It is possible to download other repositories into the main Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO repository.
Currently, this possibility works for GIPAW and West (for authorized users).
From the trunk/ subdirectory (the one containing espresso/), type
``svn propedit svn:externals espresso''.
An editor will open. Type the name of the subdirectory of ``espresso/''
where you want the repository to be downloaded, followed by the address of
the repository, exit (not quit!) the editor. Currently:
<PRE>
West  http://qeforge.qe-forge.org/svn/west/trunk
GIPAW http://qeforge.qe-forge.org/svn/qe-gipaw/trunk

12 Using git
</H1>

<P>
Git is a very populare versioning control system for collaborative development 
nowadays. The web is full of tutorials and guide about how to use it, covering 
simple novice concepts to master the most sophisticated functionalities. The 
following links contain an introduction to <TT>git</TT>:
<PRE>
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics
https://git-scm.com/course/svn.html
</PRE>
Very quick guide to <TT>git</TT> commands for the impatient:

<UL>
<LI><TT>clone</TT>: Initial download, makes a local copy of a (typically
  remote repository)
</LI>
<LI><TT>fetch</TT>:
  looks at the remote repository, signals if new files or conflicts are present
  in case the local copy is updated
</LI>
<LI><TT>pull</TT>:
  downloads updates from the remote repository, applies them to the local one.
  If there are conflicts that cannot be easily solved, conflicts are flagged
  and one has to proceed with a manual merge
</LI>
<LI><TT>add</TT>: adds files or directories to the "stage area", a pool
  of files to be commited
</LI>
<LI><TT>commit</TT> commits files in the "stage area". Unlike
  <TT>svn commit</TT>, files are committed only in the local repository
</LI>
<LI><TT>push</TT> publishes the new commits of the local repository
  to one or more remote repositories
</LI>
<LI><TT>merge</TT> merges two branches (typically the local one and
  the remote one). A merge may be easy or complex, depending upon the type of
  conflicts. See:
  <TT>https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/</TT>
</LI>
</UL>
In order to align the local repository to the svn mirror (equivalent to
<TT>svn update</TT>), it is a good idea to use <TT>fetch</TT> before
<TT>pull</TT>. Then:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>git add</TT>
  <TT>git commit</TT>
  <TT>git merge</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
In order to save incomplete work and avoid local conflicts, one can use
<TT>stash</TT>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>git stash save</TT>     (save and remove modified files)
<BR>  <TT>git pull</TT>           (update files)
<BR>  <TT>git stash apply</TT>    (overwrite with locally modified files)

</BLOCKQUOTE>
The stash can be cleared using <TT>git clear</TT>. A few useful commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>git status</TT>
<BR>  <TT>git diff</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
