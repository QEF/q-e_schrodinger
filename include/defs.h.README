                       CONFIGURATION FILES

You shouldn't need to edit the following files. The first three
are automatically generated by "configure".

* include/configure.h
  ==================
   automatically generated by configure using include/configure.h.in
   as template - contains compilation info, used in initial printout

* include/fft_defs.h
  ==================
   automatically generated by configure using include/fft_defs.h.in
   as template - included in Modules/fft_scalar.f90
   contains the type for C pointers called by fortran:
      C_POINTER is integer*8 for 64-bit machines,
                   integer*4 on most other machines
   DO NOT add C-style comments! some fortran compilers do not like them
   OBSOLESCENT: to be replaced by ISO C binding definitions

* include/c_defs.h
  ================
   automatically generated by configure using include/c_defs.h.in
   as template - included in C files in clib/ . Contains:

1) #define HAVE_MALLINFO
   if the mallinfo structure is present (Linux, AIX)

2) Macros redefining C symbols so that Fortran finds them
      F77_FUNC, F77_FUNC_
   C routine 'name' in *.c files are defined as 
      F77_FUNC('name','NAME')
   if 'name' does not contain an underscore; if it does, as
      F77_FUNC_('name','NAME')
   OBSOLESCENT: to be replaced by ISO C binding definitions

* iotk/include/iotk_config.h
  =========================
   contains definitions for iotk . Defines on output:
      __IOTK_REAL1       kind for single-precision reals
      __IOTK_REAL2       kind for double-precision reals
      __IOTK_WORKAROUND* various workarounds for miscellaneous compiler bugs
                         (accept from 1 to 10)

         PREPROCESSING OPTIONS USED IN *.h FILES AND IN THE SOURCES

Predefined by specific compilers:
      __GFORTRAN__       GNU gfortran 
      __INTEL_COMPILER   Intel compiler

Hardware / Compiler:
      __AIX       Ibm rs/6000 machines
      __SX6       Nec sx-6 vector machines (Nec compiler)
      __PGI       Portland Group compiler workarounds for compiler bugs
       _WIN32     Windows 32-bits

Parallel execution:
      __MPI       Use MPI library
      __OPENMP    OpenMP parallelization

Libraries:
      __FFTW        FFT routines from internal FFTW library (default)
      __FFTW3       FFT routines from external FFTW v.3 library
      __DFTI        FFT routines from Intel MKL library
      __ARM_LIB     EFT routines from ARM Performance library
      __LINUX_ESSL  Use blas/lapack/fft routines from IBM ESSL library
                   (linux version; aix version no longer supported)
      __SCALAPACK   Use Scalapack routines instead of internal ones
                    for parallel subspace diagonalization
      __ELPA_2015   Use ELPA library (version 2015, backward compatibility)
      __ELPA_2016   Use ELPA library (version 2016, supported)
      __MASS        Use mathematical routines from IBM MASS library
      ASL, MICRO    SX-6 specific libraries

Signals:
      __PTRACE        Enable traceback
      __TRAP_SIGUSR1  Enable signal trapping (experimental): code will stop
                      and save data if executable is signaled with USR1
IO / Reporting:
      __XSD            Enable XML format
      __HDF5           Enable I/O using parallel HDF5 (Fortran 2003 
                       features needed to compile)
      __CLOCK_SECONDS  Translate clock from HH:mm:ss to only seconds

All other preprocessing flags are for debugging purposes and should not be
used unless you know what you are doing
