     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want

     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
 
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
